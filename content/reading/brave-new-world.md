I've been meaning to read this book for several years because it's constantly compared to 1984 and I'm glad I finally did. It was about what you would expect from a dystopian novel, but some parts felt a little _too_ similar to the world as it is today. The idea of a docile society due to overstimulation makes me uneasy.
