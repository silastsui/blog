In a time where the news seems to be an endless stream of negativity and cynicism, this book was surprisingly uplifting. It explains how the world is getting better through statistics and beautiful data visualizations. It's great for putting things into perspective at a global scale and understanding the biggest problems that humanity is currently facing . I especially liked the chapter where it describes what life is like for people with different amounts of wealth and the requirements for upwards mobility.
