I really enjoyed this book. I like that it really focused on Michelle's story and that Obama was just a supporting character. I found the first half of this book much more interesting than the second half. It felt more relatable and personal. I wanted to hear about Michelle's experiences as a woman and POC much more than her experiences living in the White House. Her feeling that she wanted to succeed because she represented the community that she came from resonated with me. I also found it interesting that Michelle decided to go to Princeton because her brother went there too. It's crazy how much influence the people in your immediate network have on your decision-making.

Michelle pulling out the “if this relationship is going to work, you better get comfortable with the phone” to Obama was really a power move. Their relationship was very cute and I enjoyed reading about both of them as people. I'm amazed at how solid their relationship together is.
