*How Will You Measure Your Life* is a short, straightforward read that attempts to provide guidelines for how to live a happy, meaningful life. I didn't really enjoy it. 

The ideas in this book are not particularly insightful and there are too many unnecessary anecdotes. Most of the content is stuff you've heard before: focusing on professional success will not make you happy, invest in your relationships, etc.
