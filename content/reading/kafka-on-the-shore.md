I loved this book so much I finished it all in one day. The characters were interesting and weird and strangely connected as you might expect from Murakami. I think the alternating plotlines are used well. 

The only other Murakami novel I read before this was 1Q84, but I'm beginning to notice how Murakami likes cats, trains, the boundary between reality and the surreal, and the theme of violence against women. I want to reread this book in the future because there's so many different ways you can interpret it, especially once you know the ending.
