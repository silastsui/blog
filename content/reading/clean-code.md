This book is an easy read that will help you become a better programmer. It's great for developing some basic intuition about what well-designed software looks like and I wish I had known about this book when I was first learning how to code. There are some principles that were taken to weird extremes e.g. functions should be at most 15 lines, but most of the points are good.
